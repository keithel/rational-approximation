rational-approximation
======================

Repository of function(s) to convert real numbers to approximate rational numbers (fractions).

Contains:
* C program with inputs in command line args for the real number to approximate, and the maximum denominator value.  This code comes from David Eppstein, Chancellor's Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine.  His original code (same as here) is at: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/numth/frap.c

* Translation of David Eppstein's C code to Lua by me - Keith Kyzivat
